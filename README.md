# Catch the buses!

 **Oh no!** Tori lost the sense of time during IronBeers and now she needs to run to take the last bus to get home.
 To win, you need to catch 10 buses in less than 60 seconds, so Tori will have safe and sound. 
 
 But be aware! Avoid the old ladies, pooping birds and red traffic lights... otherwise, Tori will lose time (and you too).

## Instructions 

Use the arrow keys to move around the game display. If you catch 10 buses before the time's over, you win. If you can't do it, you will use. 

There are 3 elements to avoid: old lays, pooping birds and red traffic lights. You'll lose 5 seconds of game for everytime you touch one of them.

## About the project

This game was created by me in a week, during the Ironhack Web Development bootcamp in Lisbon, in 2022. It was inspired in one of my daily life struggles during the moment: catch the bus to get home! 

I found 'Tori' a good name to give to the main character.

<em>Catch the buses<em> was developed in Javascript, HTML and CSS (with Canvas)
