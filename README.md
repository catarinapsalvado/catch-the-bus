<h1>Catch the buses! </h1>

<b><em>Oh no!</em></b> Tori lost the sense of time during IronBeers and now she needs to run to take the last bus to get home.</p>
 <p> To win, you need to catch 10 buses in less than 60 seconds, so Tori will have safe and sound. But be aware! Avoid the old ladies, pooping birds and red traffic 
  lights... otherwise, Tori will lose time (and you too).
